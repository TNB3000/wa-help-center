How to Create Atlases in Tripper
This step-by-step guide will help you create detailed Atlases (Trippers), even if you're new to the tools. It includes all the necessary steps, from preparation to final submission.

All Trippers are created in the Tripper tool, which can be found through this link: https://ontario.app/ If you have a Whereabouts login, you should be able to use the same login with Tripper.

Creating Atlases
Preparation
Review Client Information
Details to Check:
Itinerary name

What to Do If Details Are Missing
For small items (e.g., phone number, address), find the information yourself using Google or social media.
If photos are unsuitable or missing:
Check your internal files.
Search the stopâ€™s website or social media pages.
Contact the client for replacement images

Creating Atlases

Creating a Place
In Google My Maps, use the Polygon Tool to define an area.
Connect the last point to the first to complete the polygon.
Export and convert to geoJSON.
Adding a Place
In the Tripper tool, click on "Add" in the menu at the top, then "Add Place" - a place is like a "Route" in an itinerary, it creates the map that we see on Trippers.
Enter the following:
Internal Title: A title for this route that is internal facing only.
Name: Public facing name. The name should be something related to the route rather than a creative title in case we can reuse the route again. An example could be "Toronto to Hamilton Round Trip" if there are stops between both of those cities.
Description: Optional, to describe the stops in this atlas.
Type: Using the drop-down menu, select an estimated region for where this Atlas takes place.
Center of Place: Drag the red marker to define approximately where the Atlas takes place.
Area Outline: Open the geoJSON file you saved earlier and copy all of the information in it and paste it into this section. The geoJSON data should begin with something like this: "{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":"
Website link: Optional to include a link to a website
Image gallery: Optional
Save

Finalize the Atlas
Under the "Add" button in the Tripper menu, click on "Add Atlas"
Fill in the following details:
Atlas Name (Internal)
Atlas Name
Description
Add a Poster Image and a caption for accessibility
Select a related place - this is the place you created in the "Adding a Place" section

Select Stops for your Atlas - you can either choose based on a variety of tags and a kilometer range, or by manual selection. Most of the time, you'll manually select stops using the "Manual Selection" option.
Select a team this atlas is tied to. This is the DMO or client that has ordered the atlas.
Save and submit for review.
This detailed process ensures you create high-quality, SEO-optimized itineraries and atlases that are ready for client use. If you have any questions, refer to the relevant sections or consult your team lead.
