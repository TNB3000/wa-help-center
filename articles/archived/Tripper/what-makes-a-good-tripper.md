Crafting a Great Tripper Itinerary
A good Tripper itinerary is more than just a list of stops; it's an invitation to experience a meaningful journey. Here’s how to create an engaging and impactful Tripper:

Itinerary Overview
Travel is fueled by emotions—whether it’s reconnecting with loved ones, exploring a new culture, fulfilling a dream, or taking a break from daily life. A compelling itinerary should feel like a well-told story, complete with characters, a setting, plot, and theme.

Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Your Tripper
1. Itinerary Details
Start by defining the core details of your Tripper:

Name: Give your itinerary a descriptive and enticing name.
Type of Trip: Specify the travel style (e.g., cycling, driving, RV).
Itinerary or Atlas: Decide if your Tripper will follow an ordered sequence (Itinerary) or showcase an unordered collection of stops (Atlas).
Target Audience: Identify who the Tripper is designed for.
Top-Level Description: Write a concise, engaging overview (60 words).
Hero Image: Choose a high-quality photo to represent the Tripper.
Route Link: Include a Google Map link for navigation.
2. Stops
Each itinerary should include thoughtfully selected stops:

Focus on Quality: Limit itineraries to 5–10 stops. Research shows that shorter itineraries hold travelers’ attention better than overly detailed ones.
Stop Details:
Name
Business address or coordinates
Custom description (40 words) tailored to the itinerary
Website URL and phone number
One or two high-quality photos
Complimentary information (e.g., lookout points, scenic drives)

Enhancing the Tripper Experience
To make the journey even more memorable, consider these additional elements:

Midway Points: For trails, define a midway point to help visitors focus on one part of the journey at a time. Stops beyond this point will only appear after scrolling past the midway.
Tweens: Add scenic routes or road condition details between stops. Use “Welcome To” Tweens to highlight regions or towns.
Overnight Places: If an exact location isn’t specified, guide visitors to an Atlas or external site for accommodation suggestions.
Grouping Stops: Use “Group Start” and “Group End” to create logical clusters of stops in a specific area, such as a city or region.
Glossary
Itinerary: An ordered journey guiding visitors to destinations or through regions.
Atlas: An unordered collection showcasing related stops.
Loop: Starts and ends in the same location.
Trail: Uses the same path for arrival and return.
What Makes a Good Tripper?
Focused and Concise: Select stops that align with the theme of the Tripper, keeping the total manageable and engaging.
Visually Compelling: Include high-quality images to evoke excitement and curiosity.
User-Centric Design: Tailor the Tripper to a specific audience, ensuring each element adds value to their experience.
Story-Like Flow: Think of the Tripper as a narrative—each stop should contribute to the larger journey.
By thoughtfully curating stops, leveraging emotional storytelling, and prioritizing user engagement, your Tripper will inspire travelers and provide a memorable experience.
