How to Create Itineraries in Tripper
This step-by-step guide will help you create detailed itineraries (Trippers), even if you're new to the tools. It includes all the necessary steps, from preparation to final submission.

All Trippers are created in the Tripper tool, which can be found through this link: https://ontario.app/ If you have a Whereabouts login, you should be able to use the same login with Tripper.

Creating Itineraries
Preparation

Review Client Information
Details to Check:
Itinerary name
Description
Stops and tweens (activities between stops)

Ensure Each Stop Includes:
Name
Website address
Physical address
Phone number
Photo

What to Do If Details Are Missing
For small items (e.g., phone number, address), find the information yourself using Google or social media.
If photos are unsuitable or missing:
Check your internal files.
Search the stop’s website or social media pages.

Validate the Itinerary
Stops Per Day: Ensure the schedule is realistic, with enough time for travel, activities, and meals.
Provided Map: Check if the stops and routing align with the description.
Create a New Itinerary in Tripper
Access Tripper: Log in and navigate to the itinerary creation section.
Start New Itinerary:
Click Create New Itinerary.
Enter an internal itinerary name (include the client’s name for easy reference).

Add Metadata:
Itinerary Name: This is the public-facing title.
Description: Add a brief, engaging description of the itinerary.
Tags: Add general tags to categorize the itinerary.
Select Dummy Route: Choose a placeholder route for now—you’ll replace it later.

Add Stops
How to Add a Stop
Navigate to the Stops section and click Add New Stop.
Enter the following details:
Name of the stop.
Tags: Use or create tags to make stops easier to find later.
Contact Info: Include:
Phone number
Website link
Facebook, Instagram, and TripAdvisor links (optional but helpful).

Physical Address:
Enter the address and click Pull from Address to auto-fill latitude and longitude.
If you have coordinates instead of an address, click Push to Address after entering the coordinates.

Location Tags: Add relevant tags (e.g., “Northwest Ontario” for stops in that area).
Photos:
Rename files with SEO-friendly keywords (e.g., “vegan-breakfast-restaurant-thunder-bay-ontario-tour”).
Upload the photo and add Alternative Text for accessibility and SEO (use similar wording to the filename).

Overnight Tag: If the stop is an overnight location, select this tag.

Updating Existing Stops
Search for the stop in the database.
Check for outdated information and update as needed.
Add the Reviewed [Year] tag to confirm it’s current.
Refine the Itinerary
Review Description:
Ensure the description accurately reflects the stops and activities.
Add a “Reviewed [Year]” note for clarity.

Enhance Details:
Add links to related content (e.g., travel tips, client website pages).

Arrival and Departure Info:
Arrival: Provide tips for the first day (e.g., "Arrive early for sightseeing").
Departure: Include links or tips for extending the trip (e.g., nearby restaurants or attractions).

Create the Route
Using Google My Maps
Open Google My Maps and create a new map.
Title the map to match the itinerary name (this title will be public).
Use the Directions Tool to plot the route:
Add stops in the correct order.
If there are more than 10 stops, create multiple layers. Ensure the last stop in one layer matches the first in the next.

For non-standard routes (e.g., ferries):
Use the Draw a Line tool to manually connect stops.

Export and Convert the Route
Export the map as a KML file.
Convert the KML file to geoJSON using this tool.
Add the Route to Tripper
In Tripper, go to the Routes section and click Add New Route.
Enter the following:
Route Name: Public-facing title. The title should be something related to the route rather than a creative title in case we can reuse the route again. An example could be "Toronto to Hamilton Round Trip" if there are stops between both of those cities.
geoJSON Data: Open the geoJSON file in a text editor, copy the data, and paste it into Tripper.
Length: Enter an estimated length of the route.
Location Marker: Move the red pin to the center of the route for map display.
Link the route to the itinerary and save.

Finalize the Itinerary
Link the created route to the itinerary.
Review the itinerary to ensure:
All stops are correctly placed on the map.
The itinerary shows the correct number of nights and days.
Details are clear and user-friendly.

Save the itinerary and send it for review.
This detailed process ensures you create high-quality, SEO-optimized itineraries and atlases that are ready for client use. If you have any questions, refer to the relevant sections or consult your team lead.
