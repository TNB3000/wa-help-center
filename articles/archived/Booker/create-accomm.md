How to Create a New Booker for Accommodation Products

Bookers are designed to manage single products. If you plan to rent multiple different cottages, you’ll need to create a separate Booker for each one. However, if you have multiple identical units, such as five identical cottages, you can manage these as inventory within a single accommodation product.

Creating a new Booker is divided into multiple stages. Follow these steps to get started.

Getting Started
Log in to Whereabouts.
Click on the apps menu in the top left corner, then select Booker.
Select the business for which you'll be creating the new Booker.
After choosing your business, the next step is to create the product that forms the foundation of your new Booker.

Stage 1: Creating an Accommodation Product
Click the "Create Product" button in the top right corner.
Select "Accommodation", then click "Continue".
Stage 2: Product Info
Add a name for your accommodation product.
Enter the inventory amount. If you’re offering multiple identical units (e.g., 5 identical rooms), enter "5". If it’s a single unit, enter "1".
Write a compelling description of the accommodation.
Enter a short description (useful for previews and SEO).
Click "Save" to avoid losing your progress.
You can preview your Booker at any time by clicking "Preview Booker" on the right.
Stage 3: Key Features
Click the "Key Features" tab.
Enter the number of bedrooms and specify the bed types.
Enter the number of bathrooms.
Select any amenities from the dropdown menu (no limit on amenities).
Click "Save" before proceeding.
Stage 4: Photos
Click "Upload Images" to upload your photos.
Drag the photos to set the display order. The first photo should best represent the accommodation.
Use the chat bubble under each image to add a caption (helpful for customers with low vision).
Stage 5: Pricing & Guests
Click the "Pricing & Guests" tab.
Enter the nightly rate. Currently, only one rate per night can be entered, with more pricing features coming in 2025.
Enter your minimum and maximum guest limits.
Add guest types (e.g., adults, children, seniors). A default “Adult” guest type is provided, but you can edit it.
Click "Save".
Stage 6: Upsells
If you have upsells, select them in this stage. You can also create a new upsell by clicking "Create New Upsell" (see our doc on "Creating Upsell Products" for more information).
Click "Save" to complete the process.
Embedding Your Booker on Your Website
Click "Product Actions" in the top right, then "Embed".
Customize the “Book Now” button to match your site’s design (adjust the color, font, and shape).
Click "Copy Embed Code" and paste the code on your website.
Since websites vary, consult your web developer for embedding help, or reach out to our support team under apps > help if you need guidance.
