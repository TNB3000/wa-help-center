How to Create a New Booker for Upsell Products

Upsells are add-ons that enhance other products but cannot be sold independently. They can be bundled with accommodations or fee products during the checkout process.

Getting Started
Log in to Whereabouts.
Click the apps menu and select Booker.
Choose the business where you'll create the upsell product.
Stage 1: Creating an Upsell Product
Click the "Create Product" button in the top right.
Select "Create an Upsell Instead".
Enter a name for the upsell.
Enter the price.
Click "Save" to complete the process.
Adding Upsells to Products
Once the upsell is created, you can add it to any accommodation or fee product in your account. This allows customers to see the upsell options when they book their primary product.

Embedding Your Booker on Your Website
Click "Product Actions" in the top right, then "Embed".
Customize the “Book Now” button to match your site’s design (adjust the color, font, and shape).
Click "Copy Embed Code" and paste the code on your website.
Since websites vary, consult your web developer for embedding help, or reach out to our support team under apps > help if you need guidance.
