Understanding the Different Product Types in Booker

Booker offers a variety of product types tailored to suit the needs of businesses, whether you're managing accommodations, collecting fees, or adding upsells to enhance the customer experience. Below is an overview of the product types you can create in Booker, along with details on how they can be used effectively.

1. Accommodations
This product type is designed specifically for businesses offering short-term accommodations, such as:

Hotels
Vacation rentals
Bed & breakfasts
Key Features:

Manage availability and inventory (e.g., number of rooms or units).
Provide customers with essential booking options like dates and room types.
Great for tourism and hospitality businesses.
2. Fees
A simple, standalone fee product with no attached inventory. This product type works well for businesses needing to collect payments for non-physical services or access to events.

Use Cases:

Collecting membership fees for clubs or associations.
Selling admission to online events or webinars.
Handling processing fees for specific services.
Since there is no inventory management involved, these products are easy to set up and perfect for straightforward transactions.

3. Upsells
Upsells are add-on products that can’t be sold individually. They are only offered alongside a main product (such as accommodations or fees) and appear during the booking process after a customer selects their primary product.

Use Cases:

Adding a romantic package to an accommodation booking (e.g., champagne and flowers).
Offering a firewood bundle for a campsite reservation.
Upsells enhance the value of your primary product and create more opportunities for revenue growth by bundling additional services or experiences.

4. Upcoming Product Type: Events & Experiences (Early 2025)
Starting in early 2025, Booker will introduce a new product type for events and experiences, designed for businesses that offer recurring or scheduled activities. This product type will help businesses manage reservations for:

Bar trivia nights or other recurring social events.
Guided tours like ATV or kayaking adventures.
Workshops and classes with set schedules.
This new feature will simplify booking for time-specific activities, making it easier for customers to register for their desired events. Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting release!

Conclusion
Booker’s product types give businesses the flexibility to manage bookings efficiently, whether you offer accommodations, collect fees, or enhance bookings with upsells. Each product type serves a unique purpose, helping you provide the best possible customer experience.
