How to Create a New Booker for Fee Products
Bookers can also handle simple fee products without inventory, such as membership fees or webinar admissions. Below are the steps for creating a fee product.

Getting Started
Log in to Whereabouts.
Click the apps menu and select Booker.
Choose the business where you'll create the new Booker.
Stage 1: Creating a Fee Product
Click "Create Product" in the top right corner.
Select "Fee", then click "Continue".
Stage 2: Product Info
Add a name for the fee product.
Enter the price.
Write a compelling description.
Click "Save" to avoid losing your progress.
Stage 3: Photos
Click "Upload Images" to add photos.
Drag the photos to set the display order, with the most representative image first.
Use the chat bubble under each image to add captions (important for accessibility).
Embedding Your Booker on Your Website
Click "Product Actions" in the top right, then "Embed".
Customize the “Book Now” button to match your site’s design (adjust the color, font, and shape).
Click "Copy Embed Code" and paste the code on your website.
Since websites vary, consult your web developer for embedding help, or reach out to our support team under apps > help if you need guidance.
