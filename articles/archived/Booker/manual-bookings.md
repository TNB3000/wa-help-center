Blocking Off Dates in Booker
Log in to whereabouts.tech
Open the Apps menu in the top-left corner and click on Booker
Select your business
In the top menu, click on Calendar
The calendar is where you can see all your upcoming bookings. It’s also where you can take action, like adding new bookings or closing your business temporarily. Just follow the steps below to get started:

Adding a Booking:
In the top-right, click on Calendar Actions
Select Create Manual Booking
Choose the product the customer wants to book
Enter the customer’s name and email
Select the booking dates on the calendar
(Optional) If you have any upsells, you can add them to the booking now
Click Review to check the total reservation amount
Once everything looks good, click Send Invoice. This sends the customer an email with a payment portal, allowing them to pay through Stripe.
Closing Your Business or Specific Products:
Click on Calendar Actions and choose Create Closure
For closing your entire business (this blocks all product availability):
Enter a reason for the closure (e.g., "Summer Vacation") — this is just for your internal reference.
Select the start and end dates.
Click Save.

For closing specific products:
Select the product(s) you want to close (you can choose more than one).
Give a reason for the closure (e.g., "Renovations") — this will be applied to all selected products.
Choose the start and end dates.
Click Save.

That’s it! You can block off dates or manage closures with just a few clicks. And if you need any help along the way, feel free to reach out to the Whereabouts support team under Apps > Help. We’ve got your back!
