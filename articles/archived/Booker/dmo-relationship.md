Understanding the Relationship Between Your Business and Your DMO When Using Booker
Overview
When your business partners with a Destination Marketing Organization (DMO) and is provided with Booker as an online tool, it's important to understand the roles and responsibilities involved. This guide will outline the distinct relationship between your business and the DMO, ensuring clarity on what each party is responsible for.

What is a DMO?
A Destination Marketing Organization (DMO) works to promote a specific location, helping to increase tourism and support local businesses. Some DMOs offer tools like Booker to help businesses in their area enhance their online presence, particularly for those that do not have an existing online booking system.

The Role of Your DMO
The DMO's role in providing Booker is to:

Equip your business with a booking platform: Booker is designed to give your business an online booking presence, making it easier for customers to discover and book your services.
Support your business's digital visibility: By providing Booker, the DMO aims to help you improve your online exposure, enabling potential customers to find your business more easily through DMO-backed marketing efforts.
What the DMO is NOT Responsible For
While the DMO provides Booker as a tool, they are not responsible for:

Sales performance: The DMO does not guarantee or manage how many bookings or sales your business generates through the platform.
Managing bookings: The DMO does not manage any of your customer bookings. All booking management, including cancellations, rescheduling, and customer communication, is handled by your business.
Your Business's Responsibilities
As the business owner using Booker, you hold the responsibility for:

Managing customer relationships:
Your business is responsible for handling customer inquiries, providing customer service, and maintaining communication with clients who book through the platform.

Ensuring your business gets sufficient sales:
It is your responsibility to market your products or services, attract customers, and secure bookings. The DMO provides the platform, but sales and marketing strategies are up to your business.

Creating and managing your products:
You will need to set up your services, update availability, manage inventory (if applicable), and adjust pricing within Booker. Ensuring that your offerings are accurately represented and up to date is entirely up to you.

Summary
The DMO provides Booker to help elevate your business's online presence, but it is up to your business to manage day-to-day operations, sales performance, and customer relations. Think of Booker as a tool to support your success, but one that requires your active management and engagement to thrive.

If you have any questions about using Booker or need assistance with the platform, please reach out to the support team for further guidance.
