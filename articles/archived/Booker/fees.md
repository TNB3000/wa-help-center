How Fees Work with Booker
Why Are Booker Fees Set Up This Way?

Booker’s fee structure is designed to be straightforward and flexible, ensuring that your business only pays when you make sales. We don’t believe in surprise fees or monthly subscription costs. Instead, our fees are set up to collect a small portion from each transaction. This approach ensures that during slower seasons, you won’t be burdened with maintaining your booking engine when you’re not generating revenue.

Understanding Booker Transaction Fees
When processing orders through Booker, you'll see two primary transaction fees:

Booker Fee - 4.95%
Stripe Credit Card Processing Fee - 2.9% + 30¢
Booker Fee Breakdown
The 4.95% Booker fee is divided to support both your Destination Marketing Organization (DMO) and the Tourism Tech team:

1.2% Goes to Your DMO: Your DMO receives a portion of the Booker fee to help fund their ongoing marketing efforts. DMOs invest thousands of dollars annually to attract visitors to their websites, which in turn benefits your business by driving direct bookings.
3.75% Goes to Tourism Tech: Tourism Tech uses this portion to provide continuous technical support, gather feedback, develop new features, and include your business in new product releases. Our goal is to ensure you have access to the best tools and support to succeed.
Why These Fees Matter
The fees collected are reinvested to support and grow your business:

DMO Marketing Efforts: The funds directed to your DMO help enhance their marketing campaigns, driving more traffic to their site and ultimately increasing the visibility of your business.
Tourism Tech Support and Innovation: Our share of the fees enables us to offer world-class support, continually improve our platform, and introduce innovative features that keep your business at the forefront of the industry.
By choosing Booker, you’re not just paying a fee; you’re investing in a system that’s designed to help your business thrive.
