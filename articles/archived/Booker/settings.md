How to Navigate Settings in Booker

The Settings section in Booker is where you’ll manage key elements like payment setup, taxes, calendar sync, and customer policies. This guide walks you through each section so you can efficiently set up your Booker for seamless operation.

1. Payment Setup: Create or Connect a Stripe Account
To collect payments from customers, you’ll need to create or connect your Stripe account:

Go to Settings > Payment Setup.
Follow the prompts to either create a new Stripe account or connect an existing one.
Stripe handles secure payments on your behalf, ensuring a smooth transaction process for your customers.

2. Taxes
In the Taxes section, you can configure your tax settings:

Enable automatic tax collection based on your region, or select tax-exempt if applicable.
Remember: TTC and Whereabouts do not hold or pay taxes for businesses. It’s your responsibility to follow local tax laws.
We recommend consulting a local tax expert to ensure you understand the requirements for collecting and paying taxes in your region.

3. Calendar Sync
The Calendar Sync feature helps you avoid double bookings:

Import external calendars from platforms like Airbnb into your Booker calendar.
Export your Booker calendar to external platforms by selecting the products you want to sync.
This tool ensures that your availability stays consistent across multiple platforms, minimizing booking conflicts.

4. Terms and Conditions
The Terms and Conditions section allows you to define the rules customers must accept before booking:

Outline your policies regarding cancellations, guest behavior, or check-in procedures.
For guidance on crafting effective terms, check out our support doc on creating compelling terms and conditions.
5. Cancellation Policy
Your Cancellation Policy is a separate section where you can clearly outline your rules regarding cancellations.

These policies will appear alongside the Terms and Conditions during checkout to ensure customers understand them upfront.
Saving Your Changes
After making any changes in Settings, remember to click “Save” to avoid losing your progress.
