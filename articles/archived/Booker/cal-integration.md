Setting Up iCal Integration in Booker

What is iCal Integration?
iCal integration allows businesses to synchronize calendars across multiple booking systems, reducing the risk of double bookings. This is particularly helpful for businesses managing reservations on multiple platforms, as it ensures a seamless booking experience for both staff and customers.

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up iCal integration in Booker, including importing external calendars and exporting your Booker calendar to external platforms.

How to Set Up iCal Integration
Step 1: Access the Calendar Sync Settings
Log in to whereabouts.tech.
Under the Apps menu in the top left corner, click on Booker.
In the Booker app, click on your business name, then select Settings at the top.
Scroll down to the Calendar Sync section to begin.
Import an External Calendar
Under the "Import an external calendar" section, select a product to sync calendars with.
Tip: Ensure the product name in Booker closely matches the name used in your other booking platform (e.g., if your Booker product is named "Cool Accommodation," the corresponding product in your other platform should have a similar name for seamless integration).

Copy the .ics URL from your external calendar (e.g., Google Calendar, Airbnb) and paste it into the field provided in Booker.
To sync multiple calendars, click Add external calendar link and repeat the process.
Note: There is no limit to the number of calendars you can sync with Booker.

Export Your Booker Calendar
Under the "Export your Booker calendars with an external calendar" section, select a Booker product to export.
Booker will generate a unique .ics URL for the selected product.
Copy the generated URL and paste it into your external booking system to sync.
Save Your Settings
After completing the import or export steps, click Save Settings at the bottom of the page to finalize your changes.

By setting up iCal integration, you'll have a unified view of all bookings across your platforms, making it easier to manage reservations and prevent double bookings.
