A Business Guide to Booker Transactions
Now that your Booker is built and ready for launch, it's time to run through a few payment-related features available to you. We've designed Booker to be as flexible as possible, and among its many features, you can:

Capture a partial deposit instead of the full reservation amount upfront.
Pass transaction fees directly to customers
Enable a security deposit to protect your business and cover any potential damages that may arise during a stay
We'll go through these features in detail below, but if you have any follow-up questions, our support team is happy to help and find the best solution for your business. Just send us an email at help@tourism.tech

Note: We recommend that any transaction-related decisions you make for your Booker be clearly listed in your terms and conditions.

TTC has partnered with Stripe, a secure, web-based payment processing platform, to process all Booker transactions. For more details on our Stripe integration, please check out the following guide

Capturing a Partial deposit
By default, Booker is set up to charge the customer the full amount of their reservation. However, you can opt to capture a partial deposit instead.

With this feature enabled, you have the ability to configure the following options:

The deposit percentage rate (e.g. 15% of the customer's reservation total is charged at checkout)
The day before the reservation begins on which the remaining balance is charged to the customer's payment method (e.g. charge the remaining balance 3 days before the customer's check-in date)
Note that Booker automates every part of this deposit flow. We'll take care of scheduling the balance payment and emailing the customer.

What if the balance payment is unsuccessful?
If we detect a card error with the customer's original payment method (typically due to insufficient funds), we'll send an email to both you and the customer directly. They'll be able to update their credit card information directly on their reservation page and we'll attempt to capture their balance automatically on their new card.

Passing Fees to Customers
Important: When passing any transaction fees onto customers, it's essential to ensure compliance with any applicable laws pertaining to your business. Be aware that charging processing fees is prohibited by law in some jurisdictions, so always act in accordance with the applicable regulations.

As a business, you can choose to pass Stripe's transaction fees on to customers. That said, we strongly recommend that you increase your base pricing to make up for the fees instead of passing them onto customers explicitly. This ensures that you get the net amount you want and your customers don't get confused by any added fees at checkout.

So, what are the fees exactly?
TTC charges 4.95% per transaction, and Stripe charges 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction.

Note that there are additional Stripe charges if a customer pays with a non-Canadian credit card and/or with a currency that is not CAD.

What fees can I pass on to customers?
As a business, you can pass both TTC and Stripe fees on to customers through Booker. By default, then, the total fee percentage is 7.85%, and you pass anywhere between 0% and the full 7.85% to your customers.

Our suggested breakdown would be to pass the TTC fee of 4.95% to your customers and the remaining 2.9% Stripe processing fee would be covered by the business.

What fees can I not pass on to customers?
You may not pass the following fees on to your customers:

Stripe fee of $0.30 per transaction.
Stripe fees of 0.8% & 2% for international transactions with foreign currencies - as this may occur on a case by case basis.
Note: To offset the flat transaction fees, you can increase your base prices by $0.30.

Enabling Security Deposits
While most guests are wonderful, there's always a small risk that your business could face potential damages over the course of someone's stay. To protect your business, we have a security deposit feature that can be enabled for your Booker.

If you do enable security deposits, we strongly recommend that you update your terms and conditions accordingly.

With this feature enabled, you have the ability to configure the following options:

The deposit rate type (either a percentage of the reservation total or a flat rate)
The deposit rate (e.g. 15% of the reservation total or a $250 flat rate)
How does it work? Do I have to do anything?
As with nearly everything in Booker, capturing a security deposit is fully automated. With the feature enabled, we'll put a hold on the customer's payment method 1 day before their check-out date. The customer will be emailed confirming that a hold has been put on their payment method.

This security deposit hold lasts 7 days, after which it expires automatically. This time window gives you time after checkout to inspect your properties and/or equipment for any damages and convert the hold to an actual charge on the customer's payment method.

What happens if the hold can't be placed on the customer's credit card?
If we detect a failure in attempting to place the hold on the customer's payment method, we'll send you an automated email alerting you of the issue. We'll also include a link to instructions on how to collect the security deposit through your Stripe dashboard.
