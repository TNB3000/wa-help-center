TTC partners with Stripe, a payment processing platform, for easy and secure payments. Whenever someone makes a reservation through your Booker, their payment or deposit will be routed to your Stripe account directly. The frequency of payouts can be adjusted to whatever you'd prefer — daily, weekly, or monthly. Just let us know and we'll quickly made the switch.

Getting Set Up With Stripe
Stripe has an excellent and simple onboarding flow that typically takes under 10 minutes to complete. A member of the TTC team will coordinate with you and provide you with an onboarding link. Once created, your Stripe account will be automatically associated with TTC as a partner, but is otherwise under your full control.

Note that if you already have an existing Stripe account, you can use it during the onboarding process with TTC.
Please make sure that whoever is completing the Stripe onboarding flow is the principal business owner and has easy access to financial and banking information — they'll need access to those to complete the process. Here's what you can expect:

If you don't have one yet, you'll be prompted to create a new Stripe account. Add your email and set your password.
Stripe will likely require you to set up security features to protect your account, like mobile authentication. They may also provide you with an emergency backup code — be sure to save it.
Next, you'll be prompted to select your business location and type:
You'll also need to provide additional business information, like your legal business name and your registered business address.
At this stage, you'll need to verify your personal details. As Stripe indicates, the account "should be activated by someone authorized to sign on your organization’s behalf. If that’s not you, please ask the right person to complete this form."
Next up, fill out your Fulfillment Details. In most cases, tourism operators will be selling to consumers, selling in-person services, and requiring payment from customers before they receive the product/service. If you have any questions on this, please don't hesitate to ask.



Probably the most important step — connecting your bank account for payouts!


The last step will involve adding details that will be public to your customers, like the name that will appear on their credit card statements.
