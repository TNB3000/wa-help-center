First, a couple of things to bear in mind:

We havenâ€™t settled on specific names for things yet, so we should avoid using internal terms (like Booker Beta) with external partners. Booker works fine for now ðŸ™‚
Booker Update â€” Fall 2024
Booker is currently undergoing a major rebuild, and weâ€™re close to the finish line on a beta release of this new and much improved version.

The new version of Booker will be almost entirely self-serve for tourism businesses. This means that theyâ€™ll be able to do all of the following directly in their Whereabouts account:

Create sellable products themselves across any number of businesses they manage/own
Publish these products on the web through simple embed codes to capture bookings
Manage bookings and business availability in a simple calendar
Process refunds and cancellations
Easily create (or connect to) a Stripe account in just a few clicks to capture payments
This first release of the new Booker app will be in private and limited beta starting in September 2024. Interested businesses will be able to request an invite, and those who are granted access will be asked to provide feedback to our development team on an ongoing basis. We expect to make the beta version of Booker available to anywhere between 5 and 10 businesses. If you have businesses in mind that might be a great fit, weâ€™ll have a sign-up page they can be directed to.

With the help of these beta testers, our plan is to make improvements and fix bugs throughout the fall with an eye towards a public release of Booker in Winter 2025.
