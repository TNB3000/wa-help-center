Sometimes when a business reaches out to you through Whereabouts, you want to see exactly what they see in order to properly troubleshoot. Follow these steps to give yourself the same view in Whereabouts that the business sees.

Login to auth0.com
Locate User Management on the left, then click on Users
In the Search for Users box, enter the email address of the customer that you’re assisting and click Enter on your keyboard. Click on the user profile when it appears.
From the User Details page, scroll down and locate the App Metadata section. You’re going to copy and paste all of the content in the users app metadata into your own profile.
Head back to the User Management > Users page and search for your own user. When your user shows up, click on it.
From your User Details page, scroll down to the App Metadata section and paste the metadata from the user you just copied. If you’re not familiar with coding, you should copy your own app metadata and save it somewhere secure (I like to use the notes field on Mac) so you can revert your profile back to normal later.
After you paste in the users app metadata, click on Save
These steps above will give you the same view as the business in Whereabouts. You can now login to Whereabouts with your own login and see exactly what they see. This is really handy because sometimes a business might be having trouble claiming their profile, editing their event schedule, or they have multiple businesses and they can’t find all of their business profiles through the directory.

After you’ve completed all of your troubleshooting and resolved their ticket, you can revert your own app metadata to the way it was before by removing the users details and pasting in your own.
