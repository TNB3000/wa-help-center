Why Set Up Help Scout Properly?

Setting up your Help Scout account correctly is crucial for ensuring a smooth and efficient customer experience. Proper configuration allows for clear communication, effective management of customer inquiries, and maintains professionalism in all interactions.

Steps to Set Up Your Help Scout Account
Access Your Profile
In the top right corner of Help Scout, click on your profile picture.
From the dropdown menu, select "Your Profile."

Update Your Profile Information
Ensure that your name, email address, and job title are filled in accurately. This information will be visible to customers and helps maintain transparency.
Upload a clear, professional photo of yourself. A visible photo fosters trust and helps personalize interactions with customers.

Set Maximum Chat Limit
Scroll down to the "Maximum Chats" setting and set it to 1. This controls the number of live chats you can handle at a time. Setting this to 1 ensures that you are focused and attentive during customer interactions, reducing the risk of errors.

Save Changes
After updating your information, click "Save Changes" to apply the updates.

Managing Emails and Live Chats
View Your Mailbox
Return to the "Mailbox" in the top left corner to view all available emails.
When responding to emails, prioritize them by starting from the oldest to the newest.

Set Availability for Live Chats
In the top right corner, click on your photo to open the dropdown menu and set yourself to "Available."
Our support hours are from 10 AM to 5 PM EST, Monday to Friday. Being "Available" allows you to take live chats during these hours.
Remember to set yourself to "Offline" when you're away from your desk or at the end of your workday.

Email Response Guidelines
Emails You Can Close Automatically:

New Event Submissions in Whereabouts: These do not require a response.
Booker Customer Emails (with Business CCed): These emails should be handled by the business, and we only respond if the business reaches out to us for support.
Formatting Your Email Responses:

Greeting: Always greet the customer by name if their name is available.

For anything related to Whereabouts: Introduce yourself by name, job title, and company (Whereabouts).

Additional Notes:

Addressing Multiple Issues: If the customer has mentioned more than one issue, break down your response into separate paragraphs, each addressing a single issue. This helps keep the information organized and makes it easier for the customer to follow.
Encouraging Future Communication: At the end of your email, always reassure the customer that they can reach out anytime for support if they have further questions or concerns. Let them know that our team is available to assist them whenever needed.
Closing the Email: End your email with a polite closing such as "Kind regards," "Cheers," "Sincerely," or another appropriate greeting to maintain a professional and friendly tone.
Using Saved Replies:

Before composing a response, click on the "Saved Replies" button to see if a template is available for common queries. This helps save time and ensures consistency in our communications.
Providing Technical Support:

When assisting customers with technical issues, always include clear, step-by-step instructions along with screenshots. This approach supports users with different accessibility needs.
Important Note on Whereabouts Support
Communication Channels: We never support Whereabouts customers over the phone. All interactions are handled via email or live chat. This policy helps us maintain a manageable support load.
Responding to Phone Requests: If a Whereabouts customer requests phone support, kindly reiterate that our support is available through email and live chat from 10 AM to 5 PM EST, Monday to Friday. If necessary, you can provide video tutorials for additional assistance.
By following these steps, you'll ensure your Help Scout account is set up for success, enabling you to provide top-notch support to all customers.
