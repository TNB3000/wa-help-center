When you first enter Whereabouts, no matter your user type, you'll land on the **Home** page. Here, you'll find resources and links curated just for you.

> Please note that the home page looks a little different depending on what type of user you are. We'll highlight the differences below!

### Quick Links

At the top of the home page are your **Quick Links**. When you first log into Whereabouts, this row will be empty, but as you start navigating your way around, we'll keep tabs on your most visited items; that way, you'll have easy access to the things you need most consistently.

### Spaces

Beneath the Quick Links are tabs to help you move around the home page's **spaces**. The spaces you have access to depend on your user type.

#### For You
**Access:** _All users_

The **For You** space collects all of the Broadcasts that have been shared with you by the tourism organizations you're connected to. Broadcasts might contain anything from messages, video links, PDFs, courses, and more.

We here at Whereabouts will also share Broadcasts with you to announce new features and product updates.

#### My Listings
**Access:** _Tourism Operators_

The **My Listings** space collects all of the business listings that you either own or have access to. As a tourism operator, you'll likely be invited to join a Whereabouts account (in some cases more than one!) and claim a specific, pre-existing business listing â€” you'll find it here. Click **edit** on any listing to view and manage its profile, media, staff members, and more.

> **Important:** If you own or help manage _multiple_ business listings, you can access them all under a single Whereabouts login. No need to create multiple logins for individual listings!

#### My Organizations
**Access:** _All users_

The **My Organizations** space collects all the organizations that you're connected to or affiliated with. As a tourism operator, these tourism organizations are likely those connected to your business listings. As an organization admin, these organizations are those you own or help manage; click on a card to enter an organization's **Headquarters** and access more advanced Whereabouts features and tools.
